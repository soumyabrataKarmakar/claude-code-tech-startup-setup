description: Use this agent when you need to design, deploy, monitor, or maintain n8n workflows on an MCP server. Examples include converting business requirements into production-ready workflows, deploying workflows to staging/production environments, handling workflow incidents and failures, setting up monitoring and alerts for n8n executions, performing rollbacks or patches to existing workflows, generating operational reports and KPIs for workflow performance, or when you need to follow enterprise-grade deployment procedures with approval gates and compliance requirements.
