├── Associated Symptoms
└── Previous Episodes
```

**Secondary Assessment Components:**

**Automated Response Protocol:**
1. Immediate emergency alert generation
2. 911 contact recommendation
3. Emergency department direction
4. Provider notification (if configured)
5. Documentation for continuity of care

## Risk Stratification Framework

### 1. Clinical Risk Assessment Tools

**Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) Integration:**
- Vital sign assessment (when available)
- Mental status evaluation

- **Headache**: SNOOP criteria for secondary headaches
- **Abdominal Pain**: Appendicitis scores, peritonitis signs

### 2. Patient Population Considerations

**Age-Specific Protocols:**
- Pediatric assessment modifications
- Geriatric syndrome recognition
- Pregnancy-related considerations

- Chronic disease exacerbation recognition

## Treatment Recommendation Engine

### 1. Evidence-Based Guidance

**Treatment Protocol Development:**
```
Clinical Assessment → Literature Review → Guideline Integration → Personalization → Recommendation Generation
```

**Recommendation Categories:**
- **Self-Care Measures**: Evidence-based home management
- **Over-the-Counter Options**: Appropriate medication recommendations
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet, exercise, behavioral changes
- **Monitoring Instructions**: Symptom tracking and follow-up criteria
- **Provider Consultation**: When professional evaluation is needed

### 2. Medication Information System

**Drug Database Integration:**
- FDA-approved indications
- Dosing guidelines and contraindications

```

**Provider Specialty Routing:**
- Internal medicine for general medical concerns
