# N8N Workflow Specifications

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive specifications for the 6 core N8N workflows that power our Personal Health Assistant. Each workflow is designed to leverage MCP tools for intelligent healthcare automation while maintaining clinical safety and regulatory compliance.

## Workflow Architecture

### Core Workflows

1. **[Patient Intake Workflow](patient-intake-workflow.md)** - Initial patient assessment and triage
2. **[Clinical Decision Support Workflow](clinical-decision-support-workflow.md)** - Evidence-based medical guidance
3. **[Emergency Detection & Escalation Workflow](emergency-escalation-workflow.md)** - Critical condition identification and response
4. **[Patient Context Management Workflow](patient-context-workflow.md)** - History tracking and personalization
5. **[Healthcare Provider Integration Workflow](provider-integration-workflow.md)** - FHIR/EHR connectivity
6. **[Multi-modal Interface Orchestration Workflow](interface-orchestration-workflow.md)** - Conversation management

### MCP Tool Integration

**Available MCP Servers:**
- **BioMCP**: Medical literature, clinical trials, drug information
- **PubMed MCP**: Research papers and evidence-based medicine
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex medical reasoning and decision trees
- **Memory MCP**: Patient history and context persistence
- **Brave Search**: Current health information and guidelines
- **GitHub MCP**: Documentation and protocol management

### Workflow Communication

**Inter-Workflow Data Flow:**
```
Patient Intake → Clinical Decision Support → Emergency Detection
     ↓                    ↓                       ↓
Patient Context ← Provider Integration ← Interface Orchestration
```

**Common Data Structures:**
- Patient ID and session tokens
- Clinical assessment results
- Risk stratification scores
- Provider referral information
- Emergency escalation flags

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration

**N8N Instance Requirements:**
- N8N version 1.0+ with MCP support

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets

- **Emergency Detection**: <30 seconds
- **Patient Intake**: <2 minutes
- **Clinical Assessment**: <5 minutes
- **Provider Integration**: <10 minutes
- **Context Retrieval**: <1 second

### Scalability Metrics

- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+
- **Daily Assessments**: 10,000+
- **Peak Load Handling**: 100 requests/second
- **Uptime Target**: 99.9%

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Framework

**Clinical Validation:**
- Symptom assessment accuracy testing
- Emergency detection sensitivity/specificity
- Provider referral appropriateness
- Patient safety event monitoring

**Technical Testing:**
